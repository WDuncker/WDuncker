### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️ I'm Wilhelmus or Wim for short, a full stack developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

👨‍🎓 I have completed a level 4 certificate in technology product development essentials and am just finishing off my level 5 certificate in the Mission Ready HQ advanced software developer programme.

👥 During my courses I have worked on projects both alone and in teams to create full stack applications that meet with design specifications and functionality requirement.
    In these teams I've had experience working with both other developers, and UX designers. 

💻 I have experience using HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, Typescript, React.js, My SQL, MongoDB, Docker and Node.js. I am proficient in both front end and back end development.

🧙‍♂️ I really enjoy working on the front end side of software development and seeing my work come to life on the page in front of me, I find this super rewarding.

👨‍🏫 I am about to start a sponsored internship with an international tech compnay with an office in Auckland and can't wait to get started, upskill myself and pursue future learning.

📖 My future learning plans include upskilling myself in next.js and tailwind CSS. I am also starting to explore machine learning and working toward a better understanding of AI and cloud based solutions.
