### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️ I'm Wilhelmus or Wim for short, a full stack developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

👨‍🎓 I have completed a level 4 and level 5 certificates in technology product development and am working towards my level 6 certificate in the Mission Ready HQ mentored internship programme.

👥 During my courses I have worked on projects both alone and in teams to create full stack applications that meet with design specifications and functionality requirement.
    In these teams I've had experience working with both other developers, and UX designers. 

💻 I have experience using HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, Typescript, React.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker and Node.js. I am proficient in both front end and back end development.

🧙‍♂️ I really enjoy working on the front end side of software development and seeing my work come to life on the page in front of me, I find this super rewarding.

👨‍🏫 Currently completing a sponsored internship with an international tech company at their office in Auckland upskilling myself and pursuing further learning whilst adding value to their team.

📖 My future learning plans include upskilling myself in next.js, tailwind CSS and improving my Typescript skills. I am also starting to explore machine learning and working toward a better understanding of AI and cloud based solutions.
